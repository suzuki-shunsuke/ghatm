# ghatm

`ghatm` is a command line tool setting [timeout-minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) to all GitHub Actions jobs.
It finds GitHub Actions workflows and adds `timeout-minutes` to jobs which don't have the setting.
It edits workflow files while keeping YAML comments, indents, empty lines, and so on.

```console
$ ghatm set
```

## Motivation

- https://exercism.org/docs/building/github/gha-best-practices#h-set-timeouts-for-workflows
- [job_timeout_minutes_is_required | suzuki-shunsuke/ghalint](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghalint/blob/main/docs/policies/012.md)
- [job_timeout_minutes_is_required | lintnet-modules/ghalint](https://github.com/lintnet-modules/ghalint/tree/main/workflow/job_timeout_minutes_is_required)

`timeout-minutes` should be set properly, but it's so bothersome to fix a lot of workflow files by hand.
`ghatm` fixes them automatically.

## How to install

`ghatm` is a single binary written in Go.
So you only need to put the executable binary into `$PATH`.

1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
brew install suzuki-shunsuke/ghatm/ghatm
```

2. [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

```sh
scoop bucket add suzuki-shunsuke https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/scoop-bucket
scoop install ghatm
```

3. [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/)

```sh
aqua g -i suzuki-shunsuke/ghatm
```

4. Download a prebuilt binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghatm/releases) and install it into `$PATH`

5. Go

```sh
go install github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghatm/cmd/ghatm@latest
```

## How to use

Please run `ghatm set` on the repository root directory.

```sh
ghatm set
```

Then `ghatm` checks GitHub Actions workflows `^\.github/workflows/.*\.ya?ml$` and sets `timeout-minutes: 30` to jobs not having `timeout-minutes`.
Jobs with `timeout-minutes` aren't changed.
You can specify the value of `timeout-minutes` with `-t` option.

```sh
ghatm set -t 60
```

You can specify workflow files by positional arguments.

```sh
ghatm set .github/workflows/test.yaml
```

### Decide `timeout-minutes` based on each job's past execution times

```sh
ghatm set -auto [-repo <repository>] [-size <the number of sample data>]
```

ghatm >= v0.3.2 [#68](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghatm/issues/68) [#70](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghatm/pull/70)

> [!warning]
> The feature doesn't support workflows using `workflow_call`.

If the `-auto` option is used, ghatm calls GitHub API to get each job's past execution times and decide appropriate `timeout-minutes`.
This feature requires a GitHub access token with the `actions:read` permission.
You have to set the access token to the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GHATM_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

GitHub API:

- [List workflow runs for a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-workflow-runs-for-a-workflow)
- [List jobs for a workflow run](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-jobs#list-jobs-for-a-workflow-run)

ghatm takes 30 jobs by job to decide `timeout-minutes`.
You can change the number of jobs by the `-size` option.

```
max(job execution times) + 10
```

## Tips: Fix workflows by CI

Using `ghatm` in CI, you can fix workflows automatically.
When workflow files are added or changed in a pull request, you can run `ghatm` and commit and push changes to a feature branch.
